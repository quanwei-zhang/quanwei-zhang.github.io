  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, Canada. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~pan/" target="_blank">Prof. Jianping Pan</a>. Before coming to Canada, I received my M.E. and B.E. degrees in Computer Science from Southeast University, China, where I was advised by <a href="https://csqjxiao.github.io/PersonalPage/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Qingjun Xiao</a> and <a href="https://fei-tong.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Fei Tong</a>, respectively.

    My current research interests lie in communication-efficient learning and optimization in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. My recent work focuses on enhancing data-driven intelligence over LEO constellations, as well as exploring the integration of LEO satellite systems with vehicular networks to enable robust, low-latency communication for future intelligent transportation systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am always open for collaboration and discussion. Please feel free to reach out!
